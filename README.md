# prknsndetection
This project was dedicated to the Parkinson's disease detection. The primary goal was to check whether the various image pre-processing techniques applied to drawings of healhy and sick people improve the accuracy. Due to the lack of a sufficient amount of samples, the data augmentation was applied to the images.
